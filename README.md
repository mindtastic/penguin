# Penguin

You friendly companion, protects you from being nudged hard. Whether in the schoolyard, the university, even in a Random House. Simply everywhere.

## What the actual...?

Undoubtedly, the penguin is the most sympathetic of all birds. Other birds you have to laboriously acquire and maintain, some does not even come with a decent manual. The penguin on the other hand, is always for you from the beginning and is at your service, anytime. Maybe you don't even think about it anymore he is the one keeping you works kernel going, protecting you from deadlocks, memory-leaks and other hazardous quack, making the user-space unsafe.

## Yeah ... get to the point

Okay, okay. Imagine you're getting nudged for a specifc thing over and over again. Imagine, just for illustration: A whole semester long. Maybe you know the feeling when you when you deny to do what others wanted you to do. Even if it would be the best and most pragmatic solution for you and everyone else. And to make the scenario even more vivid: Imagine furthermore all of this is about something with birds. Specific birds. Falcons? Yeah I guess, it was something with falcons.

The penguin socialized and takes care of the communication for you, even if you sometimes did not choose the easiest of the solution. Effortlessly he mediates between sailboats, birds and the cloud-born. You can just focus on what you want. And you will find yourself satisfied. In harmony with the environment and the green forest.
